This mod adds support for the [Surveyor Map Framework](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) to [Map Atlases](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/map-atlases)  
Which means the markers will add to the map automatically.  
  
It will delegate the structure/landmark rendered to the Moonlight marker.  
Currently supported markers:
- [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries)
    - Waystones by [Surveystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveystones)
    - Bell, beds, lodestone, nether portal
    - Structures
