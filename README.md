# Surveyor Atlases

Surveyor Atlases enhances [Map Atlases](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/map-atlases) by seamlessly integrating it with the [Surveyor Map Framework](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor). This integration allows map markers to be automatically added, simplifying your exploration and navigation.

The mod delegates the rendering of structures and landmarks to Moonlight Markers, providing a clean and organized map view.

Recommend setting the `terrain = DISABLED` on server side in Surveyor config(surveyor.toml) since the Map Atlases is rendering the terrain by itself. Will save performance and save size.

Currently supported markers include:
- [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries):
    - Waystones via [Surveystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveystones)
    - Bells, beds, lodestones, Nether portals, and structures
